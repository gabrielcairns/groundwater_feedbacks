This repository includes MATLAB code and data to accompany the manuscript 'Groundwater feedbacks on ice sheets and subglacial hydrology' by GJ Cairns, GP Benham and IJ Hewitt.

Please note that these scripts make use of the cmocean colormap package (Thyng et al., 2016) in order to produce figures.

The script 'make_steady_state_figures.m' can be run to generate the data in 'steady states/', and to create Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the manuscript. The script 'make_steady_state_figures.m' can be run to generate the data in 'retreat_advance/' and create Figures 6, A1 and A2. Other scripts are auxiliary functions used in the above.
